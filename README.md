A soft real-time implementation of the Processing Graph Method (PGM) on top of LITMUS^RT

Overview
========

This project aims to create a soft real-time implementation of the U.S. Navy's
Processing Graph Method (PGM) on top of LITMUS^RT---a real-time patch to the
Linux kernel [1].

Recent work by C. Liu and J. Anderson developed methods for global scheduling
of graph-based real-time applications on multiprocessors [2]. They showed
that soft real-time guarantees (bounded deadline tardiness) can be made with
no utilization loss. That is, a multiprocessor system can be fully loaded
with work while ensuring that no processing deadline is missed by more than
a bounded (predictable) amount.

Graph-based workloads can be found in pipelined software architectures. Such
architectures are very common to multimedia processing. For example, image and
audio encoding/decoding are often processed by a series of filters. These
pipelines often split into parallel pipelines only to be joined at a later
stage. Therefore, general graph-based support is necessary instead of a
serial pipeline model. Soft real-time guarantees for these workloads are
clearly desirable, but are not realized due to a lack of operating system
support.

Compilation
===========

PGM^RT supports POSIX-compatible systems. However, better performance for
real-time scheduling can be achieved by using the LITMUS^RT Linux kernel.

To enable LITMUS^RT support, uncomment 'flags-litmus' line in the Makefile.

You must patch LITMUS^RT (version 2013.1) to support PGM^RT. Source
